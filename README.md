# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and tools to develop and maintain a high quality software  system.
- it is important because it enables the creation off applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, ie commerce and communication

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- development of programming languages
- advent of structured programming
- rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- requirement -gathering and documenting user needs and requirements
- design      - creating detailed design of the software
- implementation - writting code and building software acoording to the design
- testing - testing to ensure the software meets its functional requrements and standards
- deployment - releasing the software to users
- maintenance - providing ongoing support and updaten to  the  software after its release


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- waterfall is order approach in each phase. eg requirement, then design, then implementention.
- agile is breaking it down to phases and empasizing continuous  collaboratin and  improvement

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- software developer  is the person who writes code and implemements software solutions.
- quality assurance engineer  is the person who ensures quality by designing and excecuing tests
- project manager is a person who oversees  the planning, execution  and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs enhance productivity by providing tools susch asdebugging , code testing and code writting examples are visual studio and eclipse.
- VCS help in tracking changes in the source code and fostering collaboration  among team members examplse are Git and subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenge
- tight deadlines distribute work among team memberseffectively  and prioritization of work
- technical debt, dont take shortcuts and  be as thorough as possible, while keeping the timeline and use agile methodolagies
- changing requirements, coomunicate effectively and regular reassesment of project goals

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- unit is  testing individual components of the software
- integration is testing interactionsbetween different components and subsystems
- system is testing the system as a whole
- cceptance istesting the software against the requirements to ensure it meetsthe users needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is  crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI . is is important because it helps us avoid getting vague and confusing answers

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example vague prompt : what does old art look like?
example of improved prompt : what does art before the 1400 AD renneissance look like ?
the improved prompt is better because i have clearly specified the time period of the art im looking for.
